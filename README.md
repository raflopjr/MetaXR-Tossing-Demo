# MetaXR-Tossing-Demo
A demo project exploring the Meta XR SDK for Unity (V72), focusing on object interactions, locomotion, and VR gameplay mechanics.

## Overview 
This project is a simple VR tossing game where players match colored balls to corresponding goals. Players can:

* Grab and throw balls using hand gestures or controllers.
* Launch balls with poke interactions.
* Adjust goal distances dynamically.
* Trigger UI controls in VR.

If a ball reaches a matching goal, it scores, gets destroyed, and a new ball spawns with a random color. Otherwise, the ball resets after a set time.

Assets generated by me including Scripts, Materials, and Prefabs are all under `./Assets/Custom/`


## Features
This demo implements various XR functionalities, including:

sLocomotion:
* Hand-gesture-based teleportation.
* Controller-based movement.
Object Interactions:
* Distance-based hand and controller grabbing.
* Pokeable UI canvas for the main menu.
* Pokeable 3D interactable elements on grabbable items.
Rendering & Customization:
* Adjustable goal distances.
* Custom URP shader for goal materials.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following from the Unity Asset Store:
* Meta Core SDK
* Meta Interaction SDK
* Simple Low Poly Nature (for the tree and rock arches used as goals).
* TextMesh Pro (for UI Buttons)
